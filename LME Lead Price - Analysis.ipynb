    "*Observations and Conclusions:*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low price in 2008**: The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 (tied to the housing bubble in the US, and bail-outs of financial institutions) caused a drop in metal prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Price rises and peaks in 2011**: Demand for industrial metals around the world increased as economies recovered. Chinese demand grew strongly due to its focus on public investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Price falls in 2015 and 2016**: Prices of base metals dropped sharply in 2015 and hit multi-year lows at the start of 2016. A combination of a global surplus of output in many commodity markets and decreased demand drove prices down. The World Bank specifically cited demand weakness from China as a principle reason for the fall in metal prices in 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Price rises in 2017 and 2018**:The biggest cause for rise in base metal prices was the credit-fuelled construction boom in China. Other factors included strong demand for industrial metals, especially from China, and supply constraints, including mine disruptions in Chile, Indonesia and Peru.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Price falls in 2020**: The global economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic drove commodity prices down and thus lead prices reached a low in 2020. With relaxation of lockdowns and economic recovery, prices are following an increasing trend in 2021.\n",

    "\n",
    "In **35.71%** of cases (in 5 out of 14 years), the **fourth quarter** encountered the year-round lowest price of lead. In **42.85%** of cases (6 out of 14 years), the price of lead in the fourth quarter was lower than the yearly average - these were usually periods immediately following a peak (price hike). \n",

    "In **42.85%** of cases (6 out of 14 years), the price of lead in the **third quarter** was lower than the yearly average. However, the third quarter encountered the year-round lowest price of lead only in **7.14%** of cases (1 out of 14 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the above analysis, the most suitable time to purchase lead would be in the **second quarter of the year (April, May, June)**, unless there is specifically a price hike in those months (price>₹2300). In that case (time periods directly following a peak), the best time to purchase lead would be in the **fourth quarter (October, November, December)**. The most favourable quarters, in descending order of preference are therefore - **second quarter, followed by the fourth quarter, followed by the third quarter**. The first quarter should be avoided while purchasing lead, since prices are usually high in the first quarter.\n"
